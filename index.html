  <i>"Each one of us, somewhere in his heart, the dream to make a living world, a universe."</i>
  <p>It is a fundamental human instinct, as much a part of our desire as the desire for children. It is, quite simply, the desire to make a part of nature, to complete a world which is already made of mountains, streams, snowdrops, and stones, with something made by us, as much a part of nature, and a part of our immediate sorroundings.</p>
