<h1>Building Chrysalis</h1>
<i>Each one of us, somewhere in his heart, the dream to make a living world, a universe.</i>
<p>It is a fundamental human instinct, as much a part of our desire as the desire for children. It is, quite simply, the desire to make a part of nature, to complete a world which is already made of mountains, streams, snowdrops, and stones, with something made by us, as much a part of nature, and a part of our immediate sorroundings.</p>

  <li>Set deep roots in the bay area</li>
  <li>Design and build my own home, studio, and spaces for loved ones</li>
  <li>Create freedom for artistic expression</li>
  <li>Grow food, flowers, and live as off grid as possible</li>
</ul>
